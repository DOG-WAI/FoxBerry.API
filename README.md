## Usage

### Authentication

To access protected routes, you need to authenticate using JWT. Here‚Äôs how to get a token:

1. Send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` with your credentials.
2. The response will include a JWT token.
3. Use this token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.

### Example Requests

- **Create a Post**

   ```http
   POST /api/posts
   Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "title": "My First Post",
       "content": "Hello, world!",
       "imageUrl": "http://example.com/image.jpg"
   }
   ```

- **Get User Profile**

   ```http
   GET /api/users/{userId}
   Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
   ```

### Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes. Here are some common responses:

- **200 OK**: Request succeeded.
- **201 Created**: Resource created successfully.
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.
